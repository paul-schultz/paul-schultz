### Hi, I'm Paul Schultz ðŸ‘‹

I am a sustainability professional currently based out of Huntington Beach, California, who also likes to code.  
After studying sustainability and energy policy in college I worked in the solar industry for a couple of years, from there I started working at a digital marketing agency which spurred an interest in technology. I currently volunteer my time as a Webmaster for the Sierra Club. 

Right now I am working on honing my Front End Development skills by completing projects for myself as well as for businesses and organizations, while dipping my toes into backend technologies like Node.js and React in the meantime.
