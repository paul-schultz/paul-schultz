### Hi, I'm Paul Schultz ðŸ‘‹

I am a sustainability professional based out of Huntington Beach, California.  
I currently volunteer my time as a Webmaster for the Sierra Club. 

Right now I am working on honing my Front End Development skills by completing projects for myself as well as for businesses and organizations, while dipping my toes into backend technologies like Node.js and React in the meantime.
