### Hi, I'm Paul Schultz ðŸ‘‹

I am a sustainability professional currently based out of Huntington Beach, California, who also likes to code.  
After studying sustanability and energy policy in college I worked in the solar industry for a couple of years, after which I started working at a digital marketing agency which spurred an interest in technology. I currently volunteer my time as a Webmaster for the Sierra Club. 

Right now I am working on honing my Front End Development skills by completing projects for businesses and organizations, while dipping by toes into backend technologies like Node and React in the meantime.
